# Object Detector

This repository is a pointer to [this other repository](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/object-detector), hosted under the [Swiss Territorial Data Lab (STDL)](https://github.com/swiss-territorial-data-lab/) organization, which the _République et canton de Genève_ is a co-founder and partner of.

The "Object Detector" consists in a collection of Python scripts allowing end-users to detect objects in georeferenced raster images using the [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) Deep Learning platform. Detailed information about the implemented methodology can be found [here](https://tech.stdl.ch/TASK-IDET/).

This project was initiated by the _République et canton de Genève_, then further developed by the [STDL](https://www.stdl.ch/) and used in a host of [use cases](https://tech.stdl.ch/TASK-IDET/#use-cases). Developments are still ongoing.
